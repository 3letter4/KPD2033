# KPD2033 - My Java Learning Progress

This is where I learn most of my Java concepts in the KPD2033 subject.

## 1. `GredMarkah.java` - If-Else-If Statement
In this program, I implemented an **if-else-if** statement to determine the grade (gred) based on a given mark. The program prompts the user to enter their name and marks, then uses a series of conditional statements to assign a grade according to the following criteria:

- **A+**: Marks >= 90
- **A**: Marks >= 80
- **A-**: Marks >= 70
- **B**: Marks >= 65
- **B-**: Marks >= 60
- **C**: Marks >= 55
- **C-**: Marks >= 50
- **D**: Marks >= 45
- **E**: Marks >= 40
- **G**: Marks < 40

If the marks entered are invalid (i.e., less than 0 or greater than 100), the program notifies the user that the marks are not valid.

### Key Learning:
- How to use **if-else-if** statements for conditional logic.
- How to handle different cases based on numeric input.

## 2. `TarikhLahir.java` - Switch Case Statement
In this program, I used a **switch case** statement to handle different months of the year. The user enters the day and year, followed by the month number. The program then prints the full date (day, month, year) using the `switch` statement to match the month.

The program accepts both numeric month values (e.g., "1" for January) and month names (e.g., "Januari"). If the month is invalid, the program informs the user that the month is not valid.

### Key Learning:
- How to use **switch case** to handle multiple options.
- The flexibility of **switch case** in handling both numeric and string values.
- How to use the **"enhanced switch"** syntax introduced in Java 12 to simplify code readability.
